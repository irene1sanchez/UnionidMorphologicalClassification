README for Unionid Morphological Classsification

We assembled a dataset with every measurable morphological traits:
L:H, H;W, L:W, W:H, L:M, length, sculpturing and outline



Selected six morphological traits due to high correlation R >0.6: 
L, W:L, H:L, M:L, outline and sculpturing

We converted sculpturing categories into gradients based on less sculpturing (1) to most sculpturing (6). 

Performed Hierarchical cluster

Followed Duda Hart Selection method to select number of clusters. Best options were 2,6 or 12. Selected 6 as it was the most ecologically relevant.
